            <h2 class="section__title" style="padding-bottom:15px;">My Journey through an Intolerant Education System</h2>
            <p>
                I felt an overwhelming sense of excitement upon my acceptance at University of
                Engineering and Technology(UET). I was enthusiastic about exploring new academic
                frontiers. However the excitement was short-lived. Externally, it seemed a
                promising institute but in reality, it was rotten to the core. The institute had strong
                ties with a controversial religious and militant leader. Bigotry and religious
                intolerance was a prevailing ethos while academic excellence receded into obscurity.
            </p></br>
            <p>
                There are numerous incidents which when recounted to someone not familiar with
                such a culture, may seem unbelievable. A few marginalized individuals, who are
                often labeled as traitors, raise their voice against the prevailing intolerance in the
                academic environments. One such voice is renowned Physicist and social activist
                Pervez Hoodbhoy. He has condemned religious intolerance and mediocrity prevalent
                in numerous public sector universities in Pakistan throughout his academic career.
                Here, I’ll illustrate a few such incidents that made my journey through the institute
                insufferable.</p>
            </br>
            <p>
                To begin, I’ll start with a few incidents involving a teacher responsible for teaching
                Islamic Studies. He did not cover any substantial course content throughout the
                course. Rather, he was more interested in labeling those who did not align with his
                religious and political views, as ‘infidels’. Those who opposed this derisive approach
                faced severe repercussions. Some left with tarnished academic records which greatly
                affected their academic journey. Among them was a fellow Baloch student. The
                teacher showed bias against the Balochis. The student could not withstand the
                racism and spoke up. Consequently, he faced significant academic setbacks.
            </p></br>
            <p>
                The lectures on numerical analysis deviated into sessions resembling religious
                sermons. Rather than instructing the subject, the teacher frequently digressed into
                moral and religious discussions. Only last few moments of each lecture barely
                constituted a semblance of numerical analysis content. His approach typically
                involved hastily jotting down a formula on the board, demonstrating a few iterations
                and concluding the class abruptly. Exams became a calculator race, favoring those
                with superior devices.
            </p></br>
            <p>
                These incidents barely scratch the surface of what I had to bare everyday. Although
                there were a few voices of reason, such as Dr. Haroon Babri, who really did justice
                with the subject they taught. But they were very few in number. Dr. Babri
                acknowledged the rot within the system and lamented how even brilliant minds like
                Feynman would falter in such an environment.
            </p></br>
            <p>
                I was disheartened by the institutional decay. As a result I sought solace beyond
                UET'S confines. I had a strong predilection for quantum mechanics since my high
                school days. I independently studied the subject and was fortunate enough to
                participate in building of first single photon quantum mechanics laboratory of
                Pakistan at Lahore University of Management Sciences--LUMS. Meanwhile, I started
                attending courses on mathematics and Physics at Abdus Salam School of
                Mathematics--ASSMS. One such notable course was on general theory of relativity
                taught by Dr. Amer Iqbal, a renowned string theorist. Despite its detrimental impact
                on my grades, the whole process of learning and working on the subject I cherished
                the most brought me immense fulfillment.
            </p></br>
            <p>
                Subsequently, I pursued admission at LUMS, where I was able to participate in
                research even during my undergraduate years. It was completely contrast to my
                previous institute. Faculty members here were notably well-versed by the subjects
                they taught. Although in the same national environment, LUMS exemplified to me
                the essence of an ideal academic environment.
